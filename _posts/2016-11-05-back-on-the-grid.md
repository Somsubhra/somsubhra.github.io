title: Back on the Grid

I have been off the blogging / social grid for quite a long time now (the last blog came way back in mid 2014), so I feel it's about time that I resume this blog. I have initiated this with trashing away Tumblr - my old blog (meh! I know.) and moving the old posts to Jekyll running on Github Pages.

I have been keeping quite busy with work over the past year and a half - from working quite extensively on new cloud platforms spanning over the IaaS, PaaS and Serverless space, to exploring and learning newer design and architectural methodologies, plus tinkering with technologies and frameworks which went into building these distributed and highly scalable systems. Which brings me back here - because I am quite keen to share the stuff which I have learnt during this period building these platforms.

So that said - you can expect a lot more entries from now on :)
