title: It is time to rm -rf *
---

I have recently got rid of all my major online profiles / presence including Facebook, Quora, Whatsapp, Twitter etc. Must say I have been more productive since then, not to mention stop ending up becoming the end product of all these so called technology corporations who are "making the world a better place". It is quite shameful that with zillions of things to (still) solve, our industry chooses to instead use the best minds to predict who to more sell more /insert random stuff here/ to.

I am still on quite a few platforms including
- Youtube - intend to delete it soon, don't use it anymore
- Telegram - Don't think I will get off this any time soon
- LinkedIn - For professional connections, but it has turned into more of a recruiter spamware

So, still some `rm -rf *` left to do.
